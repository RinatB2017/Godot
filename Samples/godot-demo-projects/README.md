# Godot demo projects

Each folder containing a `project.godot` file is a demo project meant to
be used with [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org), the open source
2D and 3D game engine.

## Important note

- The `master` branch is compatible with the latest Godot version (currently 3.1).
- Use the appropriate branch for your Godot version, such as the
  [`2.1`](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-demo-projects/tree/2.1) branch
  for Godot 2.1.x.
